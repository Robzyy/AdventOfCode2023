# Advent Of Code 2023 solutions

Made by yours truly, in their full, unoptimized, glory.

Made huge use of [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt). Cool lib would recommend.

I'm using C++17's [[[maybe_unused]]](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes/maybe_unused) for no reason so please either compile with C++17 or delete the attribute specifiers lol

Solutions are inside the [solutions](./solutions/) directory if it wasn't obvious enough.
